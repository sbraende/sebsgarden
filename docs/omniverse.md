# Setting up Omniverse with Ubuntu

::: warning
This is only tested with Ubuntu 22.04

Register to download omniverse:

Using sudo cp I moved <em>omniverse-launcher-linux.AppImage</em> to /opt/omniverse.

Use chmod to change the AppImage to be executable.
```sh
sudo chmod +x /opt/omniverse/omniverse-launcher-linux-AppImage
```
